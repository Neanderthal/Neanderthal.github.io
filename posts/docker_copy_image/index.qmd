### Transferring Docker Images Between Servers

Transferring Docker images between servers is straightforward using Docker's save and load functionality, combined with secure file transfer. Hereâ€™s how to do it step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Save the Docker Image
First, save the Docker image to a tar file:
```bash
docker save ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:2.0 -o tgi.tar
```
This command converts the Docker image into a tar archive, `tgi.tar`.

#### Step 2: Transfer the Image
Next, use `scp` to transfer the tar file to the target server:
```bash
scp tgi.tar <username>@<server>:/data/projects/inference_test
```
Ensure you replace `istomin` with your username and modify the server address and directory as necessary.

#### Step 3: Load the Image on the Destination Server
After transferring, log into the destination server and load the image from the tar file:
```bash
docker load -i tgi.tar
```

#### Step 4: Verify the Image
Confirm the image is loaded correctly:
```bash
docker images
```
Check for the `text-generation-inference` image in the output list.

#### Conclusion
This method provides an efficient way to move Docker images across servers without needing a Docker registry, perfect for environments with restricted internet access.
