To run your Jupyter notebook remotely without opening it in a browser, enter the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080
```

Next, establish an SSH tunnel from your local machine using this command:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <REMOTE_USER>@<REMOTE_HOST>
```

Replace `<REMOTE_USER>` with your remote username and `<REMOTE_HOST>` with the host name or IP address of your remote server.

After setting up the tunnel, access the Jupyter notebook by navigating to the following URL in your local browser:

```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
