## Short about
Hello, I'm Sergey Istomin from Saint Petersburg, Russia, a Senior Python Developer and Tech Lead with a decade-long journey in software development, system integration, and IT consulting. My expertise spans Python, agile methodologies, and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure.

My family—my wife, two sons, and daughter—is my world. We bond over sports, especially swimming and skiing, and I cherish playful moments with my little princess. Together, we value education, tradition, and the pursuit of knowledge, principles that guide our journey.

Their support fuels my professional drive and personal growth, inspiring me to balance ambition with meaningful family time. Holding a Master's degree in Computer Science and Management in Technical Systems, I'm also navigating the path toward earning a Private Pilot License (PPL). My life intertwines tech innovation with advocacy for cultural heritage and a commitment to family, shaping my narrative into one of continuous learning and exploration.
