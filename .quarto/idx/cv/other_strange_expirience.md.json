It was quite the eye-opener, diving headfirst into the world of direct sales and real-life experiences.\n\n### Computer Club Administrator - 2001-2002\nDuring my university days, I juggled studies with a part-time gig as a night receptionist at a computer club. It was an unforgettable stint, interacting with a bunch of vibrant young souls, some of whom were navigating their way through rough waters. I also got a crash course in managing cash and keeping afloat in the turbulent waters of Windows 98 networking.\n\n### Owner - Clean Windows - March 2006 - October 2006\nIn 2006, I took the plunge and opened up a small cleaning outfit called Clean Windows. Armed with nothing but a handful of business cards and sheer determination, I drummed up our initial clientele through good old-fashioned direct sales. With lunch money saved up, I invested in equipment and hired a couple of folks to tackle the grime. It was a simple yet effective business model that helped me rake in some green. But as time went on, the squeegee lost its luster, and I passed the torch to my crew before bowing out of the cleaning game.\n\n### Co-founder, Volunteer, and Technical Contributor - Sept. 2006 - Present\nSince 2006, I've been deeply involved with NGO Living City and VOOPIK, focusing on preserving our city's architectural and cultural heritage and advocating for civil rights and social activism. Our efforts have spanned exhibitions, meetings, and even strikes to highlight the importance of cultural preservation.\n\nIn addition to my role as a co-founder and volunteer, I've leveraged my technical skills to support these causes. I developed several websites and worked with maps and geo OSINT utilities to enhance our advocacy efforts. Notably, I assisted a local deputy in analyzing real estate geo-data, employing tools such as MapInfo, GoogleEarth, and ArcGIS to provide detailed insights and support decision-making processes.\n\n[http://save-spb.ru](http://save-spb.ru)\n\n### Project Manager, Event Presenter - Team Building Club - July 2005 - Sept. 2008\nFor a good chunk of time, I found myself knee-deep in organizing corporate shindigs and team-building escapades at the Team Building Club. It was a blast crafting weekend getaways and outdoor adventures for our corporate clients. Leading a team, hosting events, scouting locations, dreaming up scenarios, and tackling challenges head-on were all part of the gig. We tinkered and toiled to make each event a memorable one, and boy, did I gain some serious chops in public speaking.\n\n[https://tbclub.ru/en/](https://tbclub.ru/en/)\n\n### Weekend Aircraft Technician - 2011-2012\nIn 2011, I caught the aviation bug and decided to get hands-on experience by signing up as a weekend technician at a local airfield. Servicing Yak-52 aircraft and a Mi-2 helicopter was like diving into a whole new world of excitement and learning. Since then, one of my goals is to get a PPL one day.\n\n### Co-owner, Creator, Engineer - OWLQUEST - March 2014 - February 2016\nEver heard of OwlQuest? It was a real-life quest experience that I helped bring to life with a group of pals. As a co-owner and creator, I tapped into my electronics know-how to craft some nifty gadgets and dream up immersive scenarios. From designing printed circuit boards to tinkering with Atmega controllers, it was a whirlwind of creativity. But alas, the quest for success required more than just ingenuity, and we eventually sold off the business at break-even.\n\n### An Electronics Engineer - 2016\nFast forward to 2016, where I found myself knee-deep in a project to develop a charging station for power banks. From conceptualization to design in AutoCAD, selecting components, and crafting electrical circuits, it was a journey fueled by curiosity and excitement. Though the project never made it past the prototype stage, the experience was nothing short of electrifying.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"other_strange_expirience.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
